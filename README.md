# Application for Information Security: Identifying malicious traffic

#### You’re working as a junior data scientist for a startup that operates off of a small, local server.  The senior data scientist is wrapped up with other tasking, but leadership wants a patch for a problem and they think that it is a reasonable task for you with your experience with tabular data.

The current safeguards in place on the server do some good preventative work, but there’s been indication recently that an extra layer of security could be added if we added a detector for what our information security consultant described as “beaconing.”
They send over some recent server traffic that the consultant said had some potential evidence of beaconing and ask if you can develop a quick tool to identify this behavior.
You don’t have a lot of experience with server traffic or cybersecurity, but you look up the definition of beaconing and note that its a persistent connection made on a regular basis by a potentially malicious source.

### Specification
You are expected to deliver a github repository with the following contents:
A clearly named python script (.py). The use of this script from the command line will be what you present as a software demo and should be supplemented with whatever extra documentation or visualization you deem helpful.
A README that explains what the project is, how to reproduce your work and/or launch your software, and your notes from project planning.

### Further project requirements:
 - **Data Prep**: Outliers are investigated -- This is anomaly detection, after all!
 - **Exploration**: the interaction between independent variables and the target variable is explored using visualization and statistical testing
 - Best practices on data splitting are followed
 - The final script’s documentation is sufficiently explanatory and of high quality
decisions and judgment calls are made and **explained/documented**
 - All python code is of high quality
### Guidance
Look a bit into the idea of beaconing and see how you might define it.
Once you get the basic idea, try to see how you could define it in a way that one of our anomaly detection techniques could detect, and check out what you find in a notebook!
